# Denoising Dirty Documents
## Introduction:
This project is based on Kaggle's competition: https://www.kaggle.com/c/denoising-dirty-documents
The challenge is to removed different types of synthetic noises from scanned texts.
## Approach:
Small windows (e.g [equation](http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciweavers.org%2Ftex2img.php%3Feq%3D32%2520%255Ctimes%252032%26bc%3DWhite%26fc%3DBlack%26im%3Djpg%26fs%3D12%26ff%3Darev%26edit%3D0)) of the scanned texts are passed through an autoencoder-like neural network. Detailed architecture can be found in code and project report.
## Some demo (from competition's test files):
